# Addition of strings
# stri = "My name is"

# name = " Adarsh"

# print(stri + name)

# How to make temp

# name1 = "ADARSH"
# name2 = "YASH"

# temp = "This is {} and {} is my best friend".format(name1, name2)
# print(temp)

# Now introducing 'f' string It is also doing same thing which we have done above.
# ITS also very important to understand.

# =>

# name1 = "Adarsh"
# name2 = "Yash"

# temp  =  f"My name is {name1} and {name2} is my best friend"    # This is the syntax of "f" function
# print(temp)

# 3. %   Modulo operator

# a = 6
# b = 3
# expo = a**b    (Exponential operator)
# mod = a % b    (Modulo operator)
# fd = a // b    (Floor Division operator)
# print(expo, mod, fd)
